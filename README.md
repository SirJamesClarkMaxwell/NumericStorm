This is a numerical library written in modern C++. It will be developed as part of the Semiconductor Studio project.Now we are working on the fitting module, specifically on the Nelder-Mead optimization technique, also called the Downhill Simplex method. 


Next, we will work on the multivariate Newtown method, the Greatest Descent method, and the Levemberg-Marquardt optimization technique.
